# NotSoNice
This is intended for educational purposes only and should NOT be used for any other purpose.

When you run NotSoNice you get some information about yourself in your console, such as your public IP, your Discord token (if you use Windows), a screenshot without having to give permission and much more. 

I have made this code as clear as possible so that it is easy to understand. You should see the code as a collection of methods, it is just packaged as a program so that you can try it out and see how one jar is enough to get all the information. Something like this can also be hidden in Minecraft clients.

# Note:
I didn't write most of this code myself because, as I said, it's a collection of methods packaged as a single program.

## Usage
Just compile it and run it in your IDE, you will get something like this:

```
Discord token: NullPtr (are you using windows?)
User name: lars
Public IP: 69.187.420.222
OS: Linux
Java version: 17.0.9
```
